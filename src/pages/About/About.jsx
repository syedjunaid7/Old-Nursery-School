          <p>
            At Little Millennium, we follow a thoughtfully formulated design
            language when deciding on preschool infrastructure, that provides a
            perfect blend of style, aesthetics, reliability, child friendliness
            and functionality. <br />
            Every Little Millennium centre follows a child-centric preschool
            infrastructure design methodology, which provides a safe and
            hygienic environment with a crisp colourful ambience for their
            all-around growth and development. This is backed by quality
            teaching and learning aids that work together to ensure the
            all-around holistic development of each child.
